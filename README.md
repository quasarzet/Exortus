# Exortus

This is the first website that I have created, is about a futuristic fictional company regarding mobility. I used HTML, SASS, Plain Javascript, and only a few libraries;
AXIOS for contacting an API, GSAP for animations and Hammer.js for touch support. I coded the burger menu, the slideshow, the accordions, the splash screen, a couple incremental
functions and the modal from scratch wihout using other libraries just to make sure I understand how those work.
